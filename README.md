# About the project
The Snake game is a classic arcade-style video game where the player controls a snake that moves continuously across the screen. The goal is to eat food items that appear randomly, which causes the snake to grow in length. As the snake grows, the game becomes more challenging because the player must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game typically ends when the snake crashes into itself or the boundaries of the game area. Snake is known for its simple but addictive gameplay and has been adapted to various platforms since its introduction in the late 1970s.
